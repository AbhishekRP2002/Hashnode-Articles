In this article, we will explore some of the best free online courses that can help you build an understanding of Large Language Models and Generative AI

### **Defining Large Language Models, also known as LLMs**

From a layman's perspective, we can define a Large Language Model (LLM) as a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can generate text, translate languages, and answer your questions in an informative way, whereas from a developer's or let's say Machine Learning Practitioner's perspective we can define it as language model possessing an unprecedented level of generality, resulting from the combination of [scaling](https://towardsdatascience.com/language-model-scaling-laws-and-gpt-3-5cdc034e67bb) and [attention-based neural architectures.](https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/)

LLMs are trained on massive amounts of text data, which allows them to learn the patterns and structures of language. This makes them capable of producing human-like text, translating languages accurately, content creation, sentiment analysis, and answering questions in a comprehensive and informative way.

### **The Evolution of LLMs: From GPT to GPT-4**

LLMs have come a long way since their inception. One of the most notable series of LLMs is the GPT (short for ‚ÄúGenerative Pre-trained Transformer‚Äù) series developed by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). Starting with GPT, each iteration has improved upon the previous one, leading to more powerful and versatile models. What made the GPT model so special was that it was one of the first language models to use the Transformer architecture. This is a type of neural network that's great at understanding long-range dependencies in text data, which made it possible for the model to generate highly coherent and contextually relevant language output. With [117 million parameters](https://uxplanet.org/gpt-4-facts-rumors-and-expectations-about-next-gen-ai-model-52a4ddcd662a?gi=5e90ed4f5380#:~:text=GPT%2D1%20had%20117%20million,more%20parameters%20than%20GPT%2D2.), the GPT model was a real game-changer for natural language processing. Since then, we've seen the development of even larger and more impressive language models, like [GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2), [GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps), and [BERT](https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-brief-introduction-to-bert/)

The latest version, [GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4), is an incredibly advanced model that can perform a wide range of language tasks with impressive accuracy. It has been trained on vast amounts of data, which allows it to generate highly relevant and contextually appropriate responses.

Apart from the GPT series developed by OpenAI, there are several other notable Large Language Models including, Google‚Äôs [PaLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311), Meta‚Äôs [LLaMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971) family of models, and many other [open-source fine-tuned LLMs](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard) at present.

### Why should you care about this trend?

ChatGPT is probably the best tool launched in this decade and all the hype since it launched in November last year is for real. Indeed, ChatGPT has taken the world by storm üíπ. Within a week of its launch, it had 1 million users.

In simple terms, It's gonna make our lives easier from major perspectives, if not all, as it has its challenges and risks.

With its ability to process large amounts of text data and versatility, LLMs can be used for a wide range of applications, from chatbots that can hold conversations with users to content-generation tools that can write articles or product descriptions.

Large Language models can help reduce the time and cost of developing NLP applications as well. After all, as the saying goes "The sky's the limit".

In this article, I have curated a list of the *best free GenAI courses for 2023.* These courses cover a wide range of topics, from understanding the fundamentals of LLMs to advanced techniques for leveraging their potential in various applications.

Whether you are a beginner or an experienced user, these courses are designed to equip you with the skills and knowledge needed to excel in working with Large Language Models.

Without any further due, Let‚Äôs dive in and discover the best Generative AI(LLM) courses to enhance your skills and stay ahead in this exciting field!

### Final Thoughts

Personally, I believe, Creativity will be the limit in this new world of Generative AI with the growing offers of LLMs and their empires of volumes of data, processing, and knowledge to be generated with each new version.

As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, they have already demonstrated remarkable achievements in various domains. For instance, LLMs have been employed to produce authentic and captivating dialogues for chatbots, facilitate language translations with near-human precision, and compose inventive content such as poetry, code, and scripts.

With the ongoing advancement of LLMs, their influence on our lives is expected to expand significantly. Potential applications include enhancing customer service quality, automating tasks within professional settings, and introducing novel forms of entertainment and education.

Nonetheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that LLMs possess certain limitations. They may occasionally generate inaccurate or deceptive information and exhibit biases in their responses. Consequently, it is essential to remain cognizant of these shortcomings and exercise caution when utilizing LLMs.
